The idea for acting first came when Jane was in Paris during a 2 year hiatus in her education at Vassar. There she met Lee Strasberg. Of this encounter she had said "I went to the Actor's Studio and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my father - who had to say so - told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life."

    In a rally organized by Vietnam Veterans Against the War, or VVAW. After receiving the title of Honorary National Coordinator, she went on a series of tours in college campuses in order to raise funds.

<p>
Janes first cause to visit North Vietnam was to see the bombing of the North Vietnamese dikes. After finishing her photographs and tours, she concluded the U.S. had been intentionally damaging the Red River dikes. It was after these tours she was photographed sitting on a North Vietnamese Artillery gun. It was this photograph that caused Americans to nickname Jane Hanoi Jane. Of the event, jane gave this account;
</p>
<p>
	It happened on my last day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit ... The translator told me that the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: "All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness." These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do. The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return ... I memorized a song called "Day Ma Di", written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me ... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all had nothing to do with where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed ... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen ... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever ... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.

Throughout her two weeks in North Vietnam, Fonda make radio broadcast documenting the destruction she had witnessed in NV, speaking out about the U.S. involvement in the war. During her visit, she visited one of the POW camps, speaking to many of the men and brinign messages home to their families. When POWs were released, and came back to the U.S. with stories of torture, starvation and misery Jane called the men "hypocrites and liars and pawns", and referring to the men she had visited during her tour, she said "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed."
